# Website

**Learning objectives:**

-   Create a package website with {pkgdown}.
-   Deploy a package website with GitHub Actions.
-   Customize your package website.

## This is super easy! {-}

> We hear that some folks put off “learning pkgdown”, because they think it’s going to be a lot of work. But then they eventually execute the two commands we show next and have a decent website in less than five minutes!

[![A tweet from Jon Harmon: I put of creating a pkgdown site for my various #RStats projects because I thought I didn't have time to learn how. Then Monday I typed usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages() and voila this exists: r4ds.github.io/cookies Sometimes just try the thing!](images/19-website/jon_discovers_pkgdown.png)](https://cookies.shinyworks.org/)

(now at [cookies.shinyworks.org](https://cookies.shinyworks.org/))

## We're so close already! {-}

We already have:

-   Function help
-   Dataset documentation
-   Vignettes/articles
-   `README` and `NEWS`

{pkgdown} wraps all of that into a website

## It's so easy! {-}

-   `usethis::use_pkgdown()`:
    -   Creates `_pkgdown.yml` ({pkgdown} config)
    -   Adds {pkgdown} things to `.Rbuildignore`
    -   Adds `docs/` (local render) to `.gitignore`
        -   We'll use GitHub Actions to build the real site
-   `pkgdown::build_site()`: render locally & open in browser

## It's even easier! {-}

`usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`:

-   (runs `usethis::use_pkgdown()`)
-   Initializes `gh-pages` in pkg GitHub
-   Turns on GitHub Pages & points to `gh-pages` branch
    -   Free for public repos!
-   Copies GHA workflow config to `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml`
-   Adds URL as homepage for GitHub repo
-   Adds URL to `DESCRIPTION` & `_pkgdown.yml`

## Is that it? {-}

-   You can be done if you want!
-   Lots more customization options!
-   `vignette("pkgdown", package = "pkgdown")` = good place to start

## Hex logos {-}

-   #RStats 💗 hexagons!
-   Design specs and sticker printing businesses @ [hexb.in/sticker.html](http://hexb.in/sticker.html)
-   [{hexSticker}](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) 📦 for that
-   `usethis::use_logo()` to scale & add logo to site

## Functions reference {-}

-   `reference/` = list of all function help pages
-   {pkgdown} automatically lists all exported docs
-   `[function()]` and `[pkg::function()]` auto-link
    -   Be sure to use steps above to set up properly

## Functions reference organisation {-}

-   `reference/` alphabetical by default
-   Can curate with `reference` field in `_pkgdown.yml`
-   Example: [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/)
    -   (we'll see how on next slide)

## Functions reference example {-}

```
  reference:
  - title: Data Frame Verbs

  - subtitle: Rows
  desc: >
    Verbs that principally operate on rows.
  contents:
  - arrange
  - distinct
  ...

  - subtitle: Columns
  desc: >
    Verbs that principally operate on columns.
  contents:
  - glimpse
  - mutate
  ...
```

## Vignettes & articles {-}

-   `Vignettes in *Articles* drop-down
-   Link between vignettes with `vignette("some-topic")` or `vignette("some-topic", package = "somepackage")`
    -   Reference functions with backticks and ()

```
`thisfunction()` or `otherpkg::otherfunction()`
```

## Vignettes & articles organisation {-}

-   *Articles* alphabetical by default
-   `?pkgdown::build_articles` to customize

## Non-vignette articles {-}

-   Articles = vignette-like things but not shipped with 📦
-   Allow you to avoid executing gnarly code
    -   Code requiring authentication (e.g. {googledrive})
    -   Use 📦 but don't want to formally depend on it
    -   Lots of figures/videos > CRAN's size constraints

## Development Mode {-}

Different site for release vs development!

-   `_pkgdown.yml` `mode:` field = `release`, `development`, `auto` (& `unreleased`)
-   `release` (default) = single site w/ everything
    -   Fine for most packages
    -   [readr.tidyverse.org = release (CRAN)](https://readr.tidyverse.org)
-   `devel` = separate site in `docs/dev`
    -   [readr.tidyverse.org/dev = devel (`pak::pak("tidyverse/readr")`)](https://readr.tidyverse.org/dev)
-   `auto` = automatically switch based on vnum
-   FYI `unreleased` basically puts `devel` in `docs`
