# Website

**Learning objectives:**

- Why a website benefits your package  
- Some handy `usethis::` and `pkgdown::` functions to automatically generate the website  
- A workflow to publish to the internet using Git, GitHub Actions & GitHub Pages  
- Optional extras to customise your pkgdown site  

## A website to call home  

- Our package has many different documents:  
  - Function documentation (or help topics)  
  - Documentation of data sets  
  - Vignettes (and/or articles)  
  - `README` and `NEWS`  
    
- We can bring together all of our documentation into an easy to navigate website  
- The pkgdown package contains some easy to use functions to create a website automagically if your package has a valid structure  

## `usethis::use_pkgdown` - Initiate a site  

- `usethis::use_pkgdown()` is run once and will create a minimal setup where we can then start to use pkgdown  
- This will:  
  - Create a `_pkgdown.yml` file (the main config file for pkgdown)  
  - Adds things to `.Rbuildignore` (stops pkgdown things being included in your package bundle)  
  - Adds `docs/` to `.gitignore`. This co-opts you into building and deploying your website elsewhere (GitHub Actions & Pages). `docs/` would just be used to render as a local preview  
  
## `pkgdown::build_site()` - render your site  
- You will repeatedly use `pkgdown::build_site()` to render your website locally  
- This should render and open your website in your default browser  
- You can look in the `docs/` directory to see the files that make up your package  
- Congrats! You now have a barebones, locally rendered website... but how to deploy to the internet?  

## Deployment 

- The easiest way to show your website on the internet is to:  
  - Use Git & host the package on GitHub  
  - Use GitHub Actions to run `pkgdown::build_site()` every time you push a change to GitHub  
  - Use GitHub Pages to serve your static website  

## `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`  

- `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()` is called once and will run through several steps:  
  - Initialises an empty orphan branch in your GitHub repo (`gh-pages`)  
    - This branch only exists on GitHub and only tracks the files that make up the website (i.e. what we see in `docs/`)  
  - Turns on GitHub Pages for your repo and points it to the `gh-pages` branch  
  - Copies the config file for a GHA workflow (shows up in `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml`)  
  - Adds the URL for your site as the homepage for your GitHub repo  
  - Adds the URL for your site to `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml`  

- It may take a couple of minutes, but you should now be able to visit the website URL (you will see it listed in the console output).  
  - the default URL is in this form:  
  `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME/`
- You have a website! Sweet as!  

## C'est fini?  

- You could stop here if you wanted, you have a basic website that is helpful to users  
- Or you could make it look even more sweet by customising stuff (`vignette("pkgdown", package = "pkgdown")` is a good place to start)  

## Hex logos  

- The six sided logos and stickers that everyone loves  
- Design specs and sticker printing businesses can be found [here](http://hexb.in/sticker.html)  
- There's an [R package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) for that  
- When you have your logo, `usethis::use_logo()` will scale and add your logo to your `man/figures/` folder. pkgdown will also discover this and add to your site  

## Functions Reference Index  

- the `reference/` contains a page for each function that has a `.Rd` help topic in `man/`  
- pkgdown will execute and render all of your examples  
  - This is a good opportunity to make sure they look the way they are supposed to  
- The help topics will be linked to locations within/outside of your site  
  - hark back to chapter 17 and recall enclosing functions in `[]` when mentioned in roxygen comments  
  - pkgdown will automatically hyperlink to the relevant pages for your function.  
  - Inbound links from other people's packages require extra work:  
    - Published to CRAN  
    - the `URL` field in the `DESCRIPTION` file must be populated with the URL of your pkgdown site and GitHub repo  
    - your `_pkgdown.yml` file must include the URL for your site.  
  - devtools generally does this configuration for you  
  
## Functions Index Organisation  

- The reference index is an alphabetically ordered list of functions  
- You might like to curate this if you have lots of functions  [(e.g. dplyr)](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/)  
- This can be done by providing a `reference` field in `_pkgdown.yml` e.g. for dplyr:

  ```
  reference:
  - title: Data Frame Verbs
  
  - subtitle: Rows
  desc: >
    Verbs that principally operate on rows.
  contents:
  - arrange
  - distinct
  ...

  - subtitle: Columns
  desc: >
    Verbs that principally operate on columns.
  contents:
  - glimpse
  - mutate
  ...
  ```
  
## Vignettes and articles  

- A packages vignettes will appear (rendered) in the _Articles_ drop down menu  
- Vignettes can also be linked to automatically (recall using `vignette("some-topic")` inline from Chapter 17)  
- pkgdown will detect that format and automatically link to it on your website. Use this format in your roxygen comments:  
  - for your own vignette `vignette("some-topic")`  
  - for an external package vignette `vignette("some-topic", package = "somepackage")`  
  - this will not work for non-vignette articles (use a normal URL for these e.g. `[]()`)  
  - make sure to use backticks and parentheses when you refer to a function in vignettes e.g.:  
    ```
    `thisfunction()` or `otherpkg::otherfunction()`
    ```  
    
## Vignettes and articles Index organisation  

- The default is to have your vignettes/articles appear alphabetically  
- You can customise this
- `?pkgdown::build_articles` has more info on this

## Non-vignette articles  

- Non-vignette articles are not shipped with the package bundle  
- The main reason to have a non-vignette article is to avoid executing gnarly code  
- This might be due to:  
  - The code requiring authentication (e.g. googledrive package)  
  - You use a package but don't want to formally depend on it  
  - Content with lots of figures that causes size issues (e.g. larger than CRAN's size constraints)  

## Development Mode

> The development field allows you to generate different sites for the development and released versions of your package. ~ [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_site.html#development-mode)  

- In the `_pkgdown.yml` file there is a `mode:` field. This can be set to `release`, `development`, `auto` and more.  
- `release` is default and site gets written to `docs/` (just use this if you have a small user base). This will generate a single site, but a user downloading from CRAN may get documentation from your in development documents (e.g. functions that may not exist in the CRAN package yet)  
- `devel` site is writen to `docs/dev/` and gets a danger class, and a tool tip warning these documents are in development. A `noindex` tag stops search engines indexing this site. You would have two sites the CRAN release in `docs/` and the development release in `docs/dev/`  

  - Example of this:    
    - readr.tidyverse.org documents the released version, i.e. what install.packages("readr") delivers.
    - readr.tidyverse.org/dev/ documents the dev version, i.e. what install_github("tidyverse/readr") delivers.

- `auto` will automatically determine the mode based on the version number (use if your package has a broad user base)
