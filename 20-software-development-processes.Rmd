# (PART) Maintenance and distribution {-}

# Software development practices
**Goal**: zoom back now and consider software development practices

- More productive  
- Raise quality of work  
- (more reproducibility?)

## Recommendations 

- An IDE with support for R package development  

- Version control (Git) + Hosted version control (GitHub)

- Continuous Integration / continuous deployment: Mostly automatic `R CMD check`

Pros: 

- Do the right thing: **experiment, document, test, check, collaborate**

- Use the same tools/workflows than experts

## Git and Github

Git manages the evolution of a set of files (repository).

- 94 % of VC is Git

- GitHub is dominant followed by GitLab and bitbucket

- Lot of resources: [Happy git and Github for the useR])(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/validate/vignettes/cookbook.html)

It allows: 

- Communications with users (Issues)

- Collaboration (PR, ask features)

- Distribution (`devtools::install_github`) or now with `pak` install specific SHA

(SHA-1 is sude by Git instead of adding numbers, Secure Hash Algorithms)

- Website: see `pkgdown`  

## CI/CD

For a package: 

1. Source package in GH  
    * Multiple developers have permissions to push   
    * External can push via PR
    
2. Main idea: development tasks can be executed automatically when certain events happens

Example: Automate R `CMD check`

### More!!! GitHub Action (GHA)

`usethis` have function that copy some GHA workflow into a specific folder `.github`.

You have a curated already made workflow here : https://github.com/r-lib/actions/#readme

When using `usethi::use_github_action_check_standard`

```
#> ✔ Creating '.github/'
#> ✔ Adding '*.html' to '.github/.gitignore'
#> ✔ Creating '.github/workflows/'
#> ✔ Saving 'r-lib/actions/examples/check-standard.yaml@v2' to .github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml'
#> • Learn more at <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2/examples/README.md>.
#> ✔ Adding R-CMD-check badge to 'README.md'```
```


* Create `.github/workflow/`

* Add new needed lines in `.gitignore`

* Add a shiny badge at the top of your README.md

It has plenty of other uses! 

- `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_page()`

- `usethis::use_github_action("test_covergae")`
