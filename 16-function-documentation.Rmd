# (PART) Documentation {-}

# Function documentation

**Learning objectives:**

- Describe the benefits of well developed object documentation
- Discuss the definition of object documentation 
- Identify the key components of object documentation for different R objects
  - Functions
  - Packages
  - Generics, classes, and methods
- Demonstrate the object documentation workflow
- Discuss some general formatting and style guidelines

## Why care about object documentation?

- Documentation is an important component of packages 
  - How will users know how to use your package?
  - Inform your future self
  - Inform other contributors

## Object documentation defined

- Focus for tonight is on object documentation
  - What do you think when you hear the word object?
  - Accessed via `?` or `help()`
- **Object documentation**: reference documentation. 
  - Purpose is to serve as a reference (e.g., a dictionary entry) 
  - Great use case for standardized naming conventions (e.g., `stringr` package)
- Difference between object documentation and vignettes
  - **Object documentation** = A short-form reference guide
  - **Vignettes** = A long-form document on how to use package objects to solve a problem

## Object documentation, an overview

![](images/10-object-documentation/10-roxygen-namespace.png)

- Documentation files are rendered from a syntax loosely based on `LaTex`.
  - `HTML`
  - Plain text
  - PDF
  - More on this syntax can be found in the [`R extensions manual`](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Rd-format)
- [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) provides a more user-friendly syntax to create documentation 
  - Comments using `@tags` >> `man/.Rd` files >> `HTML` or PDFs
  - Code is intermingled with documentation
  - Handles some boilerplate set up
  - Abstracts away the differences for documenting different objects
  - Manages the `NAMESPACE` (Chapter 13) 
  
## The documentation workflow

- Two workflows
  1. Fast, but links don't work
  2. Slow, but the links work
    - You may need to adjust some settings if build and reload doesn't work

## Rendering, behind the scenes

## The nuts and bolts of `roxygen` comments

- Four basic building blocks:
  1. **`#'`** - `roxygen` comment
  1. **Multiple `#` lines** - a block
      - Wrapped at 80 characters (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + / or reflow comment)
  1. **Tags** - Breaks up the blocks
     - `@tagName details`
  1. **Introduction**
     - First sentence is the title
     - Second paragraph is the description (what does the function do?)
     - Paragraphs >= 3 allow for more detail 
- All objects must have a title and description

- Details are optional

- Blocks and tags give documentation structure

## Documenting functions

- Most commonly documented object
- Three common tags:
  1. `@param name description`: describes the function's inputs or parameters.
     - These need to be documented
     - Multiple arguments can be documented in one place `@param x,y description`
  1. `@examples`
     - Provides executable code on how to use the function in practice
     - Must run without errors or use `\dontrun{}`
     - **Keep in mind:** Most users will look at examples first 
  1. `@return`
     - Describes the output from the function.

- Addional tags
  - `@section`
  - `@seealso`
  - `@family`
  - `@alias`
  - `@keyword`
  - Checkout the [Rd (documentation) tags vignette](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html)

- Keep style conventions top of mind
  - Check out the book for more details

- [`ggplot2` example](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/R/aes.r)

## Documenting datasets

- A different process, see [Chapter 14](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html).

## Documenting packages

- Provide a help page for your package as a whole
  - `package?foo`
- Intended to describe the most important components of the package
- Great place to put package level import statements
- [`ggplot2` example](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/R/ggplot2-package.R)

## Documenting classes, generics, and methods

- S3 generics
    - Are regular functions, so document them as such.
    - [`dplyr::glimpse()` example](https://github.com/r-lib/pillar/blob/main/R/glimpse.R)
    
- S4 classes and methods
    - Use `@slot` to document the slots of the class.
    - Aim to keep all your documentation together
    - Use `@rdname` or `@describeIn` to keep docs together
    - Control ordering of code loading by using `@include`  
    
- RC (reference classes)
    - Uses the docstring in the method for the documentation
      - Is included within the 'Methods' section
    - You now only need one `roxygen` block per class
    - Uses the `@field`
    - See the `account` example in`regexcite`
    
## A note about special characters

- `@` denotes a tag, so use `@@` for a literal `@`
- `%` denotes start of a `LaTex` comment, so escape for a literal `%` `\%`
- Escape your backslashes (e.g., `\\`)

## Do repeat yourself

- Self-contained documentation vs. [`DRY` (don't repeat yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
- Limit user frustration resulting from navigating multiple help files
- Two ways to handle:
   1. `@inheritParams`: reuse parameter documentation
      - From source `@inheritParams function`
      - From another package `@inheritParams package::function`
      
```{r inherit_params_example, eval=FALSE}
#' @param a This is the first argument.
foo <- function(a) a + 10

#' @param b This is the second argument.
#' @inheritParams foo
bar <- function(a, b) {
  foo(a) * 10
}

# Equivalent to

#' @param a This is the first argument.
#' @param b This is the second argument.
bar <- function(a, b) {
  foo(a) * 10
}
```

   1. `@describeIn` or `@rdname`: document multiple functions in one place
      - Use with caution. Can lead to confusing documentation.
      - See the `foobar` example
      - See the `arithmetic` example

## Text formatting

- Check out the [reference sheet](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#text-formatting) in the book
  - Use as a reference
- Generally follows a `LaTex` like syntax
  - `\formatLikeThis{yourText}`
- Formatting that can be applied:
  - Character formatting
  - Linking to other docs or materials
  - Lists
  - Mathematical notation
  - Tables
