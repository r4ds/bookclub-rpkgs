# (PART) Package metadata {-}

# DESCRIPTION

**Learning objectives:**

  - Understand the purpose and the typical contents of `DESCRIPTION` file and the most important package metadata
  - Declare dependencies with `Imports`, `Suggests`, `Depends`, `LinkingTo`, and `Enhances` fields
  - Add `Title`, `Description`, `Authors`
  - Preview `License`, `Version`

You need this to make your packages recognizable to R and other packages, 
but it will also help you understand how other packages are being set up
and how they interoperate.

## `DESCRIPTION` File {-}

- `DESCRIPTION` file stores important metadata about a package.
  + Required pkgs, what pkg does, maintainer contact info, etc.
  + Myriad of tools interact with `DESCRIPTION` file; most
   importantly `install.packages("your_package")` or
   `remotes::install.github("you_are/your_package")`
- Every package has `DESCRIPTION`; anything with `DESCRIPTION` is a package 
- `usethis::create_package("mypackage")` adds `DESCRIPTION` file
- `DESCRIPTION` file format = DCF (Debian Control Format; see [`read.dcf`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/dcf.html))
  + Each line is a field `Name: value` (the name is typically in proper case)
  + If a value has multiple lines, indent the overflow lines by 4 spaces. 
- [{desc}](https://desc.r-lib.org/) can help with `DESCRIPTION` files programmatically. 
  

## Example `DESCRIPTION` File {-}

```
Package: mypackage
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person("First", "Last", , "first.last@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: The description of a package is usually long,
    spanning multiple lines. The second and subsequent lines
    should be indented, usually with four spaces.
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a
    license
Encoding: UTF-8
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.2.0
```

## Title {-}

`Title` = 1-line description of the package

- Plain text
- Nominal Sentence in Title Case
- Does not end in a period
- Shows on CRAN download page & `Packages` tab in RStudio
- Keep it short (some tools truncate to 65 characters)
- Do not include package name
- Put the names of R packages, software, and APIs inside 'single quotes'
- Do not start with "A package for..." or "This package does...".
 
## Description {-}

`Description` can be up to a paragraph

- One paragraph with 2 to 4 sentences giving a concise description of 
  what the package does or what it is for
- Each line up to 80 characters
- Indent subsequent lines with 4 spaces
- Put the names of R packages, software, and APIs inside 'single quotes'
- Can use acronyms here
- If you want to add more detailed info, add it to `README.md`

## Title & Description Example {-}

```
Title: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics
Description: A system for 'declaratively' creating graphics,
    based on "The Grammar of Graphics". You provide the data, tell 'ggplot2'
    how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use,
    and it takes care of the details.
```

## On CRAN {-}

![](./images/09-description/title_cran.png)

![](https://r-pkgs.org/images/cran-package-ggplot2.png)

## Version {-}

- Package number in the form `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
  or `<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<dev>`
  * See principles at https://semver.org/
  * *Major* version when you make incompatible API changes
  * *Minor* version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
  * *Patch* version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
  * Other engagement rules: see e.g.
    [BioconductoR](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/versionnum.html#versionnum)
- Parsed and compared by
[`base::package_version()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric_version.html)
- Forms the basis of dependency checking

The topic of version numbering will come up again later in 
[Chapter 21](https://r-pkgs.org/lifecycle.html#sec-lifecycle-version-number).

## Author: who are you? {-}

- `Author:` + `Maintainer:` plain text or `Authors@R:` executable R code `utils::person()`
- Fields are used to generate citation for the package
- Email is required for the package maintainer
    * provide the email address that you will have access to for a while
      for bug reports and feedback

```
person(given = NULL, family = NULL, middle = NULL,
       email = NULL, role = NULL, comment = NULL,
       first = NULL, last = NULL)
```

## Authors@R in Practice {-}

```
Authors@R: person("Hadley", "Wickham", email = "hadley@rstudio.com",
  role = c("aut", "cre"), comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-1234-5678"))
```

- Name (given, family)
- Email address
- Role: Every packages needs at least one author (aut) and one maintainer (cre)
  - **`cre`: current maintainer**
  - **`aut`: authors who have made significant contributions**
  - `ctb`: made smaller contributions
  - `cph`: copyright holder if someone other than author
  - `fnd`: funder
- Comment
  - Can use this to add [ORCID](http://orcid.org)

## Multiple authors {-}

List multiple authors with `c()`:

```
Authors@R: c(
    person("Hadley", "Wickham", email = "hadley@rstudio.com", role = "cre"),
    person("Winston", "Chang", email = "winston@rstudio.com", role = "aut"),
    person("RStudio", role = c("cph", "fnd")))
```

## URL and BugReports {-}

- `URL`: 
    * the github development repo
    * the compiled `bookdown` / `pkgdown` site
- `BugReports`:
    * the github issues page
    * the email address of the maintainer
- `usethis::use_github()` and `usethis::use_github_links()` 
    automatically generate these


```
URL: https://devtools.r-lib.org/, https://github.com/r-lib/devtools
BugReports: https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues
```

## License {-}

- License field is mandatory
- If you want to share your package, include a license.
- You can use `usethis::use_*_license()` for configuration.
- More in Chapter 12!

## `Imports` & `Suggests` {-}

- `Imports`:
  * you use `package::function()` in your code
  * hence your package users will need the imported package at runtime
  * will be installed or updated when users install your package
  * `library()` will complain if the available version is below the one
    that the package requires
- `Suggests`:
  * packages needed for dev tasks, vignettes, tests, other optional functionality (not required) 
- Both use comma-separated list of package names (ideally 1 pkg/line, alphabetical) 

# `usethis::use_package()` {-} 

- Most of the time, should indicate the minimum specific package version (`arrow (>= 14.0.0)`)
  * User will be asked to update (if necessary) when they install your package
- What min version to indicate requires careful consideration! 

```
# Default is 'Imports'
usethis::use_package('dplyr', min_version = '1.0.0')
# Use whatever you have installed as minimum 
usethis::use_package('ggplot2', type='Suggests', min_version = TRUE)
```

## Dependencies {-}

Development tools like `devtools::check()` and `renv::status()` may be able
to find the missing dependencies. 
Most often, these happen when you `library(something)` interactively 
and it is easily available to you when you write and execute the code.

Dependencies is the topic of the whole next chapter (Ch10).

Declaring a minimum version number...

- ensures that the end users will get the functionality they need, but...
- adds to frustration on enclosed environments where only system administrators 
  have the privileges to `install.packages()`
- adds to the frustration of projects with tightly balanced version dependencies  

## `Depends` and `Linking to` {-}

- `Depends` is the deprecated way to declare dependencies
- These days, `Depends` is only used to indicate a min version of R itself: 
  `Depends: R (>= 4.0.0)`
  * **Main takeaway:** if you state the minimum R version, 
    have a reason & take reasonable measures to test your claim regularly
- `Linking to` indicates if your packages uses C or C++ code from another package. 
- `Enhances` = packages are 'enhanced' by your package
  - It's sometimes hard to define this so we recommend not to use it. 

## An R version gotcha {-}

- Before April 2018: `.rds` files used `version 2` serialization format
- Since April 2019: `.rds` files use `version 3` serialization format
- R < 3.5.0 (before April 2018) can't read `.rds` v3
- When `.rds` saved as v3, package depends on R >= 3.5.0

```
NB: this package now depends on R (>= 3.5.0)
  WARNING: Added dependency on R >= 3.5.0 because serialized objects in
  serialize/load version 3 cannot be read in older versions of R.
  File(s) containing such objects:
    'path/to/some_file.rds'
```

- If you want to support R < 3.5.0, be careful about `.rds` version
- The base pipe `|>` requires R >= 4.1.0

## Other fields {-}

-  `Version` where pkg is in lifecycle / how it's evolving (Ch21)
-  `LazyData: TRUE` if pkg has data for users (won't need `data()`)
-  `Encoding: UTF-8` by default (most common) 
-  `Collate` controls the order in which R files are sourced 
    (may be an issue when S4 classes are used)
-  `VignetteBuilder` lists what the pkg needs as a vignette engine (Ch17) 
-  `NeedsCompilation: no` if only R code and no C/C++/Fortran/Rust/JS code
-  `SystemRequirements` dependencies external to R in plain text for human eyes

```
SystemRequirements: C++17
SystemRequirements: GNU make
SystemRequirements: TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/)
``` 

- Don't use `Date` field, will auto-populate on build 

## Custom fields {-}

Full list of `DESCRIPTION` options in the 
[Writing R Extensions](https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-exts/Creating-R-packages.html#the-description-file).

You can also created your own, but CRAN has constraints:

- Don't re-purpose official field names used by R
- Only English words
- Use `Config/` prefix or `Note` suffix

## What you edit vs. what other tools edit {-}

Some parts of `DESCRIPTION` are automatically updated by the package
development and documentation tools, e.g. `devtools::document()` or
`devtools::build()` will add something like:

```
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.2.1
```

More on that in [Chapter 16](https://r-pkgs.org/man.html).

- `devtools::check()` and `R CMD check` will complain if anything
in `DESCRIPTION` is not proper.
- extensive management tool provided by [`{desc}`](https://desc.r-lib.org)
